The information we obtain in this manner enables us to customize the services we offer to Customers and Users of our Website, to deliver targeted advertisements, and to measure the overall effectiveness of our online advertising, content, programming, or other activities. Web beacons (also known as clear gifs, pixel tags or web bugs) are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of web users or to access cookies. Unlike cookies, which are stored on Your device, web beacons are embedded invisibly on the web pages (or in emails) and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.

    <p>We (or service providers on our behalf) may also use the pixels to collect certain personal information about You, such as Your email address and Your IP Address. If no email addresses are identified via certain pixels, the data collected from the pixels is immediately deleted.</p>
    <p>We specifically use Pebble Post to support our marketing efforts. Pebble Post uses a pixel to collect information about Your visit to our Website and then combines it with other information that we have shared with them in order to support their provision of marketing services. Specifically, Pebble Post may collect Your Personal Information (including your name, email address and physical address), and Your online identifiers (including cookies already on Your device, mobile device ID information and related information on Your browsing activities) automatically via its pixel on our Website.

    <h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;a. The bareMinerals Text Messaging Program</h3>
    <p>If You have signed up to receive text messages from us, we may collect information from You through one of our inbound text messaging programs.

In addition to the message itself, we may also collect Your geolocation information as well and use that information to send You personalized marketing messages. We do not share Your mobile telephone number with any third parties to use for their own promotional/marketing purposes.

    <h2><span id="pp11"></span>&nbsp;XI. Information Collected about You from Third Parties</h2>
    <p>We collect Your Personal Information and Sensitive Personal Information for various reasons, which are described below:</p>
    <h3>a. To Service Our Website</h3>
    <p>We use information collected to ensure that our Website is working as intended and for analytics purposes, to understand how our Website are operating and learn how they can be improved. We also use this information as needed for auditing purposes.</p>
    <h3>b. To Fulfill Your Order and Provide Our Products to You and Facilitate any Exchanges and Returns</h3>
    <p>We use information collected to process and ship Your order(s), to inform You about the status of Your order(s), facilitate any exchanges or returns, and to follow up with You about Your satisfaction with the ordered products.</p>
    <h3>c. To Maintain Your Account</h3>
    <p>We may use information collected to maintain Your accounts with us, including administering any programs associated with such accounts.</p>
    <h3>d. To Make Personalized Product Recommendations to You</h3>
    <p>We may use information collected to provide You with bareMinerals product recommendations, offers, and rewards that are tailored to Your interests and profile.</p>
    <h3>e. For Our Marketing Purposes</h3>
    <p>If You have filled out a contact form with us, signed up to receive our alerts or newsletter, or have otherwise signed up to receive our direct communications, we may use this information to send You marketing communications, such as email communications, mobile messages (including text and/or push notifications), and postal mailings. These communications may inform You about new products, store events, special discounts and coupons, beauty tips, and other news and special offers. On occasion, these communications may also contain information or offers about third party products. In some instances (such as for mobile messages), we may use technical information or precise geo-location information obtained from Your mobile device to send You messages directly to Your mobile device, including offers and coupons based on Your location.</p>
    <p>We may also use collected information to show You ads that are targeted to reach people (or people similar to people) who have visited our website or are identified in one or more of our databases ("Matched Ads"), including bareMinerals’ ads on our sites or on other sites. This is done by bareMinerals uploading a customer list to the third-party ad network or incorporating a pixel from the third-party ad network on our website, and the third-party ad network matching common factors between our data and their data. Some of these ads may try to entice You to come back and revisit our site for new offers and promotions. This type of advertising typically involves an ad network collecting and tracking certain technical information (such as Your IP address) and website usage information (such as Your browsing history) on our sites and across many other sites on the Internet.</p>
    <h3>f. To Evaluate and Improve our Customer Service</h3>
    <p>We may use this information to ensure we are providing the highest level of customer service, and to identify any potential gaps or potential improvements to the same. Customer service may be provided through various forms of communication, such as email correspondence and call center support.</p>
    <h3>g. To Evaluate, Improve, and Customize Our Products</h3>
    <p>We may use information collected to improve our products, tailor them to Your needs, and come up with new product ideas.</p>
    <h3>h. To Administer Contest and Promotions</h3>
    <p>We may use information collected to administer a contest, sweepstakes, giveaway, competition, or other similar marketing campaign or promotion. To comply with sweepstakes laws, we may publish or share limited information about promotion winners (such as name and city of residence). For more information about our contests and other promotions, please see the official rules or details that will be posted with each promotion.</p>
    <h3>i. In Order to Respond from Requests from You</h3>
    <p>If You have requested further information or in any other way requested that we contact You, we will use Your Personal Information to respond to such a request.</p>
    <h3>j. To Provide a Personalized and Convenient Website Experience for You</h3>
    <p>We may use information collected to personalize Your experience and save You time when You visit our Website. For example, we might remember Your login ID or username so You can quickly login the next time You visit our site or so You can easily retrieve the items You previously placed in Your shopping cart. Based on this type of information, we might also show You specific bareMinerals content or offers that are more relevant to Your interests.</p>
    <h3>k. To Facilitate and Support Our Website Community Features</h3>
    <p>We may use information collected to give You access to our website community features, such as features that may allow You to upload and share ratings, reviews, questions/answers, stories, pictures, videos, or other content. Because these types of features are “communal” in nature, information You post in these areas may be visible to others. Please use caution when using these features or uploading content to a bareMinerals Website. For some community features, You may have the ability to control whether some parts of Your profile can be seen by others and whether we send You notifications about certain community activities (like the fact that one of Your questions has been answered). To access these settings, go to the “My Account” section of our site and login to the relevant community account. For community features that are integrated with third party social networks such as Facebook, see separate section on “Third party social networking” below.</p>
    <h3>l. To Facilitate and Support Our Website’s Viral Features</h3>
    <p>Where permissible under applicable law, we may request and use collected&nbsp; information so You can use our website viral features, such as tell-a-friend. These features allow You to easily share certain bareMinerals’ news, product information, promotions, wish list items, or other content with family members and friends. These features typically require the collection and use of certain personal contact information (such as email addresses and names) so that the selected message or content can be delivered to the proper recipients. In some instances, this information may be stored in our records so we can track and reward our customers for their referrals. For tell-a-friend or other viral features offered by third-party social networks (such as Facebook “Share” and “Like” features), there may be additional privacy concerns for the information collected by these third-party sites. You should review the individual third-party social media provider’s privacy policy for more information.</p>
    <h3>m. To Facilitate and Enable Your Interactions with Third-party Social Media Providers</h3>
    <p>We may use information collected to support and run contests, to allow You to share content (such as beauty tips, articles, stories, etc.), and to allow You to sign up for certain bareMinerals accounts, or for other stated purposes as disclosed via the relevant advertisement or promotion.</p>
    <h3>n. For Our Other General Purposes</h3>
    <p>We may use information collected for other general business purposes, such as to maintain the day-to-day operation and security of our Website, and to conduct internal marketing and demographic studies.</p>
    <h3>o. For Our Legal Purposes</h3>
    <p>We also collect information in order to comply with certain legal rules and regulations that we are subject to.</p>
    
    <h2><span id="pp12"></span>XII. How Long Do We Store and Maintain Your Personal Information?</h2>
    <p>We only store and maintain Your Personal Information for as long as is necessary to fulfill the purpose for which it was collected. For example, if You sign up to receive Our newsletters or to receive job alerts, We will store and maintain Your Personal Information to continue to send You these materials until You opt out of receiving such communications. With regards to Your Personal Information collected for our analytics purposes and used to help maintain and improve Our Website, We only store and maintain that information until it is aggregated and used to create a new anonymous data set that no longer contains Your Personal Information, and then delete the underlying Personal Information once that new data set has been created. If You are one of our valued Customers and have created an account with us, we store Your Information as long as Your account remains active, and then delete it when You delete the account, with the exception of any information that we are legally required to maintain longer. If You are a Customer and You do not have an account, we only store Your information as long as needed to support Your purchase and relationship with us.&nbsp; When we no longer have a legal need, or You close or delete Your account with us, or otherwise ask us to delete Your account, we will do so securely in accordance with our document retention policy.</p>
    
    <h2><span id="pp13"></span>XIII. How We Use and Share Your Personal Information for Our Marketing Activities</h2>
    <p>bareMinerals may share Your Personal Information with certain third party vendors in order to support our marketing activities. We work with these vendors to identify potential new customers and/or to identify new products or services that may be attractive to You specifically. This includes targeted advertising and may include mailing marketing materials directly to Your home address. Under the laws of certain jurisdictions, this type of sharing may be considered a sale of Your data.</p>
    <p>As noted above, we specifically work with Pebble Post and share Your Personal Information and if applicable, Your past purchasing history with them. Pebble Post may also collect Your Personal Information (including your name, email address and physical address), and Your online identifiers (including cookies already on Your device, mobile device ID information and related information on Your browsing activities) automatically via its pixel on our Website. You can Opt Out of this collection <a href="https://www.bareminerals.com/pages/privacy-web-form">here</a> and You can learn most about Pebble Post’s Privacy Practices here: <a href="https://www.pebblepost.com/privacy-policy/">https://www.pebblepost.com/privacy-policy/</a>.</p>

    <li>Commercially available and sufficient firewalls;</li>
